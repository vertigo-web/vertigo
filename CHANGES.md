## Unreleased

### Fixed

* Restored `ToComputed<Resource<Rc<T>>>` implementation for `LazyCache<T>`.

### Changed

* `AttrGroup` now holds Rc's to callbacks so it now implements `Clone`.

## 0.8.0 - 2025-07-15

### Added

* Tailwind support (internal rust-only, and external node-based) [#353]
* `js!` macro which allows to evaluate simple JavaScript expressions. [#372]
* Added `v-css` and `v-component` attributes in rendered DOM to help debugging (added only in debug mode) [#367]

### Changed

* `Value::set` now doesn't trigger graph update if new value is the same as the old one. [#368]

  This means, `T` should now implement `PartialEq`.
  `Value::set_force` was introduced for `T` which doesn't implement `PartialEq`
  but this method always updates graph just as the old `set` method.

* `on_click` attribute now provides `ClickEvent` to allow preventing default or stopping propagation.

### Fixed

* `DomElement::get_ref()` [#375]

### Removed

* `window!` and `document!` macros (replaced by `js!`).
